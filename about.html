   <h5>
       cybercrime is a crime that involves a computer and a network. The computer may have been used in the commission of a crime, or it maybe the target. Cybercrime may harm someone's security and financial health.  
   </h5>
   <h5>
    Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network. While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them, while others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both -- i.e., target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.
   </h5>
   <h4>
    Types of cybercrime
    </h4>
    <h5>
    As mentioned above, there are many different types of cybercrime; most cybercrimes are carried out with the expectation of financial gain by the attackers, though the ways cybercriminals aim to get paid can vary. Some specific types of cybercrimes include the following:
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Cyberextortion: A crime involving an attack or threat of an attack coupled with a demand for money to stop the attack. One form of cyberextortion is the ransomware attack. Here, the attacker gains access to an organization's systems and encrypts its documents and files -- anything of potential value -- making the data inaccessible until a ransom is paid. Usually, this is in some form of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin.
    </h5>  
    <h5> 
    Cryptojacking: An attack that uses scripts to mine cryptocurrencies within browsers without the user's consent. Cryptojacking attacks may involve loading cryptocurrency mining software to the victim's system. However, many attacks depend on JavaScript code that does in-browser mining if the user's browser has a tab or window open on the malicious site. No malware needs to be installed as loading the affected page executes the in-browser mining code.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Identity theft: An attack that occurs when an individual accesses a computer to glean a user's personal information, which they then use to steal that person's identity or access their valuable accounts, such as banking and credit cards. Cybercriminals buy and sell identity information on darknet markets, offering financial accounts, as well as other types of accounts, like video streaming services, webmail, video and audio streaming, online auctions and more. Personal health information is another frequent target for identity thieves.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Credit card fraud: An attack that occurs when hackers infiltrate retailers' systems to get the credit card and/or banking information of their customers. Stolen payment cards can be bought and sold in bulk on darknet markets, where hacking groups that have stolen mass quantities of credit cards profit by selling to lower-level cybercriminals who profit through credit card fraud against individual accounts.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Cyberespionage: A crime involving a cybercriminal who hacks into systems or networks to gain access to confidential information held by a government or other organization. Attacks may be motivated by profit or by ideology. Cyberespionage activities can include every type of cyberattack to gather, modify or destroy data, as well as using network-connected devices, like webcams or closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras, to spy on a targeted individual or groups and monitoring communications, including emails, text messages and instant messages.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Software piracy: An attack that involves the unlawful copying, distribution and use of software programs with the intention of commercial or personal use. Trademark violations, copyright infringements and patent violations are often associated with this type of cybercrime.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Exit scam: The dark web, not surprisingly, has given rise to the digital version of an old crime known as the exit scam. In today's form, dark web administrators divert virtual currency held in marketplace escrow accounts to their own accounts -- essentially, criminals stealing from other criminals.
    </h5>
   <h4>
    Effects of cybercrime on businesses 
   </h4>
   <h5>
    The true cost of cybercrime is difficult to assess accurately. In 2018, McAfee released a report on the economic impact of cybercrime that estimated the likely annual cost to the global economy was nearly $600 billion, up from $45 billion in 2014.
   </h5>
   <h5>
    While the financial losses due to cybercrime can be significant, businesses can also suffer other disastrous consequences as a result of criminal cyberattacks, including the following:
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Damage to investor perception after a security breach can cause a drop in the value of a company.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    In addition to potential share price drops, businesses may also face increased costs for borrowing and greater difficulty in raising more capital as a result of a cyberattack.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Loss of sensitive customer data can result in fines and penalties for companies that have failed to protect their customers' data.Bus inesses may also be sued over the data breach.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Damaged brand identity and loss of reputation after a cyberattack undermine customers' trust in a company and that company's ability to keep their financial data safe. Following a cyberattack, firms not only lose current customers, but they also lose the ability to gain new customers.

    </h5>
    <h5>
    Businesses may also incur direct costs from a criminal cyberattack, including increased insurance premium costs and the cost of hiring cybersecurity companies to do incident response and remediation, as well as public relations (PR) and other services related to an attack.
    </h5>
    <h4>
    Effects of cybercrime on national defense
    </h4>
    
    <h5>
    Cybercrimes may have public health and national security implications, making computer crime one of DOJ's top priorities. In the United States, at the federal level, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Cyber Division is the agency within DOJ that is charged with combating cybercrime. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sees strengthening the security and resilience of cyberspace as an important homeland security mission. Agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have special divisions dedicated to combating cybercrime.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    USSS' Electronic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) investigates cases that involve electronic crimes, particularly attacks on the nation's financial and critical infrastructures. USSS also runs the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides state and local law enforcement, judges and prosecutors with training in computer forensics. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a partnership among the FBI, the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), accepts online complaints from victims of internet crimes or interested third parties.
    </h5>
    <h4>
    How to prevent cybercrime
    </h4>
    <h5>
    While it may not be possible to completely eradicate cybercrime and ensure complete internet security, businesses can reduce their exposure to it by maintaining an effective cybersecurity strategy using a defense-in-depth approach to securing systems, networks and data.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Cybercrime risks can be reduced with the following steps:
    </h5>
    <h5>
    develop clear policies and procedures for the business and employees;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    create cybersecurity incident response management plans to support these policies and procedures;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    outline the security measures that are in place about how to protect systems and corporate data;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    use two-factor authentication (2FA) apps or physical security keys;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    activate 2FA on every online account when possible;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    verbally verify the authenticity of requests to send money by talking to a financial manager;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    create intrusion detection system (IDS) rules that flag emails with extensions similar to company emails;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    carefully scrutinize all email requests for transfer of funds to determine if the requests are out 
    </h5>
    <h5>
    continually train employees on cybersecurity policies and procedures and what to do in the event of security breaches;
    </h5>
    <h5>
    keep websites, endpoint devices and systems current with all software release updates or patches; and
    </h5>
    <h5>
    back up data and information regularly to reduce the damage in case of a ransomware attack or data breach.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Information security and resistance to cybercrime attacks can also be built by encrypting all computers' local hard disks and email platforms, using a virtual private network (VPN) and by using a private, secured domain name system (DNS) server.
    </h5>
    <h4>
    Cybercrime legislation and agencies
    </h4>
    <h5>
    As mentioned above, various U.S. government agencies have been established to deal specifically with the monitoring and management of cybercrime attacks. The FBI's Cyber Division is the lead federal agency for dealing with attacks by cybercriminals, terrorists or overseas adversaries. Within DHS is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This group coordinates between private sector and government organizations to protect critical infrastructure.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Furthermore, the Cyber Crimes Center (C3) provides computer-based technical services that support domestic and international investigations included in the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) portfolio of immigration and customs authorities. C3 focuses on cybercrimes that involve transborder illegal activities; it is responsible for finding and targeting all cybercrimes within HSI jurisdiction. C3 includes the Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU), the Child Exploitation Investigations Unit (CEIU) and the Computer Forensics Unit (CFU).
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Various laws and legislation have been enacted in addition to the agencies that have been established to deal with cybercrime. In 2015, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released the cybercrime repository, which is a central database that includes legislation, previous findings, and case law on cybercrime and electronic evidence. The intention of the cybercrime repository is to assist countries and governments in their attempts to prosecute and stop cybercriminals.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Legislation dealing with cybercrime can be applicable to the general public, or it can be sector-specific, extending only to certain types of companies. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) focuses on financial institutions and regulates the implementation of written policies and procedures that should improve the security and confidentiality of customer records, while also protecting private information from threats and unauthorized access and use.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    Other legislation has been established to deal with specific cybercrimes, such as cyberbullying and online harassment. A little over half of U.S. states have implemented laws dealing directly with these crimes.
    </h5>
    <h5>
    For example, Massachusetts law cites that online harassment is a crime that is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000, a maximum of two-and-a-half years in jail or both. In Tennessee, online harassment and stalking is considered a Class A misdemeanor, and a convicted cybercriminal can face a jail sentence of, at most, 11 months and 29 days, a fine of up to $2,500 or both.
